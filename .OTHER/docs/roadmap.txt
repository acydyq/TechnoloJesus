TechnoloJesus - Development Roadmap
====================================

Project Overview:
-----------------
TechnoloJesus is a **startup simulation game** that blends **Silicon Valley-style corporate satire, chaotic tech industry rivalries, and over-the-top business schemes**. It will transition from a **text-based management game running in a GUI** (Phase 1) to a **fully interactive isometric pixel-art simulation** (Phase 3+).

Development Phases:
-------------------
The development of TechnoloJesus will be structured into **multiple phases**, each expanding the game’s mechanics, UI, and interactions.

===========================================================================
  📌 Phase 1: Text-Based GUI Simulation (CURRENT DEVELOPMENT)
===========================================================================
✔ **Core Gameplay in Text-Based GUI**
   - Pygame-based GUI with text-based interactions.
   - **Retro pixelated text UI** (NES-style aesthetics).
   - **Day/Night Cycle** (Dave the Diver-inspired).
   - **Basic Startup Economy:** Payroll, office rent, investments.
   - **Basic Employee System:** Hiring, morale, productivity.
   - **Daily Business Reports:** Earnings, expenses, performance logs.
   - **Basic Rival AI:** Competing startups that affect the industry.

✔ **Text-Based Events & Decisions**
   - Random **company disasters** (bugs, employee breakdowns, lawsuits).
   - **Nighttime Business Hustles:** Risky investments, shady deals.
   - **Passive AI-Generated Social Media** (affects company reputation).

✔ **Basic Save System**
   - SQLite-based save/load for financials, employees, rival interactions.

   - **Negotiation mechanics** for buyouts and hostile takeovers.

🚧 **Graphical Enhancements**
   - **Retro-inspired pixel HUD/UI**.
   - **Simple character sprites** in a corporate dashboard.

===========================================================================
  📌 Phase 3: Transition to Isometric Pixel-Art Simulation
===========================================================================
🚧 **Major Visual Upgrade**
   - **Office becomes a visual space** (not just a text log).
   - **Isometric Pixel-Art Graphics** (Code Monkeys-inspired).
   - **Interactable Employees & Workstations**.

🚧 **Company Customization**
   - Upgrade your **office space, furniture, and technology**.

===========================================================================
  📌 Phase 4: Full Management Sim + Multiplayer (Far Future)
===========================================================================
🚧 **Multiplayer Business Wars**
   - Compete with **other players' startups**.
   - **Market Manipulation PvP** (sabotage, hostile takeovers).
   - **Shared in-game economy** (influenced by all players).

🚧 **Full AI-Driven Startup Simulation**
   - Employees **evolve dynamically** (promotions, drama, betrayals).
   - AI rivals adapt to **player tactics**.

🚧 **Social Media & Viral Marketing**
   - Run **fake influencer campaigns**.
   - **Algorithm Manipulation** to control public opinion.

===========================================================================
  📌 Final Vision: The Ultimate Startup Satire
===========================================================================
TechnoloJesus will become a **hilariously unethical startup sim**, blending:
