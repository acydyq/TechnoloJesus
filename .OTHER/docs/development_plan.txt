# 🚀 TechnoloJesus - Full Development Plan (Restarting from Scratch)
====================================================================

## 📌 Overview
TechnoloJesus is a **text-based startup simulation game** running in a **GUI**, heavily inspired by:
- **Silicon Valley (TV Show)** – Startup chaos, corporate absurdity, and rivalries.
- **Code Monkeys (TV Show)** – NES-style humor, irreverent game development culture.
- **State of Decay 2 (Game)** – Character skills, morale, and progression system.
- **Dave the Diver (Game)** – Day/Night activity loop (work by day, chaos by night).
- **Trailer Park Boys (TV Show)** – Scrappy, makeshift startup shenanigans.

## 📌 Project Goals (Phase 1)
1️⃣ **Text-Based GUI Running the Game**  
   - **Pygame GUI-based simulation** with a **clean & easy** retro-inspired UI.
   - **Day/Night System** inspired by *Dave the Diver*:
     - **Daytime:** Manage employees, code apps, deal with crises.
     - **Nighttime:** Hustle, seek investments, run shady business deals.

2️⃣ **Employee Recruitment & Management System**
   - **GTA V Crew Recruitment + State of Decay 2 Skills System**
   - **Traits & Backgrounds** that impact morale & work performance.
   - **Star Rating Skills** (★☆☆☆☆ to ★★★★★).
   - **Quirks & Weaknesses** (employees create random chaos).
   - **Personalities & Social Conflicts** (rivalries, workplace drama).
   - **Firing, Exiling, or Ruining Employees** (Startup Hunger Games).

3️⃣ **AI-Driven Startup Rivals**
   - Competitors **steal ideas, manipulate markets, and sabotage your company**.
   - **Corporate Espionage & Leaks** (rivals bribe employees).
   - **Stock Market System** (player can invest, short-sell, or rig the market).
   - **Fake AI Startups & Pump-and-Dump Schemes**.

4️⃣ **Dynamic Social Media System**
   - **AI-generated drama, startup buzz, and reputation mechanics**.
   - **Employees leak company secrets** or **get cancelled online**.
   - **Players can stir controversy, manipulate PR, or silence critics**.

5️⃣ **Robust Expense System & Business Decisions**
   - **Weed & Booze as Business Expenses** (boost creativity but cause chaos).
   - **Rent, Utilities, and Team Outings** (Silicon Valley startup life).
   - **Burn Rate, Growth Rate, and Investment Rounds**.

6️⃣ **Event-Driven Chaos**
   - **Random workplace disasters, lawsuits, and office betrayals**.
   - **"Unhinged Investor" mechanic** (VCs demand absurd features).
   - **Tech Scandals** (data leaks, unethical practices, AI bias lawsuits).

## 📌 Technical Implementation
### 🔹 Core Components:
| Component            | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `main.py`           | **Game entry point** - initializes GUI & game loop |
| `core/game_loop.py` | **Handles gameplay logic** (time progression, economy, AI) |
| `core/employees.py` | **Manages employees** (hiring, skills, morale, quirks) |
| `ui/gui.py`         | **Handles UI rendering** (text-based, animated retro interface) |
| `data/game_data.db` | **Stores financials, employee data, and startup stats** |

### 🔹 Tools & Dependencies:
- **Python (3.12.6)**
- **Pygame + Pygame GUI**
- **SQLite** (for game state persistence)
- **Matplotlib** (for future business analytics)
- **GitHub** (version control for updates)
