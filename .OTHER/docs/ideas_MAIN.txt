Subject: Updated Details for *TechnoloJesus* - Backstory, Exile/Ruin System, Startup Creation, and New Features

Hi ChatGPT,

I’ve got some exciting updates for *TechnoloJesus* to enhance the player experience, including a startup creation mechanic inspired by the vibe of *Anno 2205*’s opening (but tailored to a scrappy startup feel). I’d like to refine the backstory, flesh out the "Exile or Ruin" system, and add features like customizable names and live stat tracking. Here’s the plan:

### Backstory Addition with Startup Creation
At the start of *TechnoloJesus*, I want players immersed in a detailed backstory—think *Stardew Valley*’s intro vibe with a tech twist—followed by a startup creation step inspired by *Anno 2205*’s engaging setup. Here’s how it unfolds:

**Backstory and Setup:**  
You’re a burned-out coder who’s spent years grinding in soul-crushing corporate tech jobs, your ideas buried under bureaucracy. One sleepless night, fueled by caffeine and defiance, you decide to take the leap. With $500, a beat-up laptop, and a borrowed garage from a dubious relative, you’re ready to launch your own startup. First, you’ll choose your name—any name you want. Then, you’ll create your startup: pick a custom startup name to define your vision. The dream? Build the next big app—or survive the chaos trying. The catch? Rivals, fragile employees, and a brutal tech world await. The screen fades with: *"Day 1: It’s time to disrupt… or get disrupted."*  

This keeps it gritty and personal while letting players shape their startup’s identity from the jump. Let me know if you’d like to adjust the tone!

### Expanded Exile or Ruin System with Social Media, Employee Morale, and Skill Progression
I’d like an "Exile or Ruin" system (aka "The Startup Hunger Games") to make the garage phase raw and high-stakes. Employees are emotional, unpredictable messes with unique skills and egos—here’s the breakdown:

#### Employee Morale System
- Employees have a **morale meter** (0-100%) shifting with company culture, decisions, workload, and pay:
  - **High Morale (75%+):** Faster work, innovation, loyalty.
  - **Neutral Morale (40-74%):** Bare minimum effort, some grumbling.
  - **Low Morale (20-39%):** Slacking, negativity, or leaks.
  - **Critical Morale (0-19%):** Quitting, sabotage, or online rants, risking lawsuits or mass exits.
- **Morale Boosters:** Raises, perks, creative control, good press.  
- **Morale Killers:** Overwork, firing popular teammates, lying about funds, forced “fun” (e.g., “axe throwing with Kevin from DevOps”).

#### Employee Motivation System
- Each employee has a **personal motivation** driving effort:
  - **Clout Chaser (🏆):** Needs fame—thrives on credit, leaks for attention if ignored.
  - **Gold Digger (🤑):** Money-driven—grinds if paid, slacks or defects if not.
  - **Lazy Genius (😴):** Brilliant but idle—shines when engaged, stalls otherwise.
- Meet their needs for bonuses (overtime, ideas); ignore them, and they turn lazy or disloyal.

#### Social Media System (The Twitter Wars)
- Social media amplifies everything:
  - **Firing a Popular Employee:** A viral tweet like *"Just got canned from [Your Startup Name]—no severance, no soul!"* crashes morale and funding.
  - **Ruining an Employee:** Subtle moves bury them; obvious ones spark backlash.
  - **Company Screw-Ups:** Glitches or leaks ignite Reddit/Twitter storms—spin it right to recover.
- **Outcomes:** Good PR boosts talent and cash; bad PR dents morale and trust; disaster PR triggers collapse.

#### Employee Skill Progression (Like State of Decay 2)
- Employees evolve across four skills, unlocking specializations:
  - **Hustle:** “Workaholic” (fast, burns out).
  - **Tech Literacy:** “Full Stack Wizard” (fixes all code, insufferable).
  - **Charisma:** “Tech Cult Leader” (sways anyone, even fraudulently).
  - **Problem-Solving:** “Firefighter” (solves crises, demands pay).
- Skills turn employees into assets or liabilities, deepening strategy.

#### The Big Picture
- Employees are unique—gems or ticking bombs.
- Social media and morale make choices a reputation tightrope.
- Exiling (firing) or ruining (sabotaging) has lasting fallout—lose talent or gain foes.
- Players choose: ethical empire or ruthless tech titan?

### New Features
- **Custom Names:** Players pick their name and startup name during the startup creation step. They can rebrand the startup later, but it’s earned—e.g., hit revenue or reputation milestones (Phase 2 unlock).
- **Live Stat Tracking in GUI:** Add graphs, bars, and charts to the elegant GUI for real-time stats:
  - **Morale meters** per employee.
  - **Revenue/expense line graphs** (daily/weekly).
  - **Skill progression bars** showing growth.
  - **Social media sentiment** (e.g., pie chart of positive/neutral/negative buzz).
  - These update dynamically, giving instant feedback.
- **Startup Creation Mechanics (Inspired by Anno 2205):** Beyond naming, keep it simple for now—focus on the custom name input at the start, with potential for small flavor choices (e.g., a starting perk like “+10% morale” or “extra $100”) in Phase 2.

---

### Integration with Existing Plans
- **Day/Night System:** Daytime for managing employees/projects, nighttime for social media fallout, morale crises, or skill training—tie in the new systems.
- **GUI:** The text-based game runs in the elegant GUI, with live stat visuals alongside for a sleek, data-driven feel.
- **Phase 1 Priority:** Start with startup creation, morale, motivation, and basic stat tracking in the GUI; add social media and skill progression in Phase 2.

What do you think? I love the startup creation vibe from *Anno 2205*’s opening, and I’m excited to adapt it for *TechnoloJesus*. Any thoughts on implementation or areas to expand (reputation, investors, crises)? Can’t wait to hear your take!

Cheers,
